	<h1>CIVILIZATION ESSAY</h1>
	<p>This is an essay that I wrote for my Civilization class last semester. It answers the question, <i>"Did Christianity Trimuph When It Became The Official Religion of Rome?"</i></p>
	<h2 align = "center">Unorthodox Triumph for Orthodoxy</h2>
	<p>
	The world was shocked as Constantine made the announcement that Christianity was now the official religion of Rome in 313 AD. He announced that persecution of Christianity should stop, and any damage done to them should be reimbursed. A few years later, the emperor Theodosius I in 380 AD would make Christianity the main religion of the Roman empire (Codex Theodosianus). How did this happen? This move would have shocked and even appalled earlier emperors. The emperor Nero burned down Rome and blamed it on the Christians just because he hated them. The emperor Diocletian tortured, maimed, and enslaved Christians. Rome even authorized the whipping and crucifixion of Jesus Christ. This new encouragement of Christianity in the empire was life-changing for believers everywhere. It took over the nation and changed the culture dramatically. But did Christianity triumph over its foes in a traditional takeover as the Romans would see it? This post will explain how Christianity did not triumph in the Roman way, but rather was a belief system that came with Constantine’s triumph. This is evident in the art, the way Constantine took over the empire, and how the nature of Christianity contradicts the Roman definition of "Triumph".

	To understand if Christianity triumphed in Rome, one needs to first understand what the Romans thought it meant to “triumph”, which we can understand by seeing the definition of the Latin word, and seeing an example of Roman triumph through the conquest of Judea in 70 AD. The equivalent word to “Triumph” in Latin is “Triumphus”, which is usually associated with celebrating a general as they return from a great victory (Lewis). A few examples of triumph are expressed in Roman architecture, such as the Arch of Titus. The Arch of Titus was made in honor of Titus and Vespasian’s conquest of Judea (Umrich.edu), and its architecture shows many symbols of their triumph, such as a sculpted menorah on the ceiling of the arch. This shows how the Romans viewed triumph- showing the treasures that were symbolically taken or razed during the battle and displaying that it was a big deal to win- big enough to build an expensive arch for it. Another aspect of the conquest of Judea that shows the Roman definition of triumph was the nature of the war. The Jews were rebellious against the Romans, so the Romans burned down the city, and Josephus, a Judeo-Roman scholar at the time, said that 1.1 million people died at the siege, mostly Jews. The siege of Jerusalem was a brutal massacre, and it sets out the definition of Roman triumph quite well- to crush rebellions and to assert their empire with an iron fist. So, in short, from the definition of Triumphus, the symbolism of the arch, and the nature of the battles, to triumph in Rome meant to celebrate the victory against anyone who opposed you.

	When Constantine took over Rome, there is evidence that such a triumph had happened, but many of these evidences point to the triumph of Constantine over the Roman empire rather than Christianity. One thing that proves this is when Constantine conquered Rome and became the emperor, he built an arch, like Titus did. However, this arch did not clearly display Christian symbols, as did Titus’ arch (ancientpages.com). On the contrary, this arch displayed symbols used by other Roman emperors, including pagan gods. Arches were built in response to great victories, telling of a great triumph, but the lack of Christian symbolism is evidence that the triumph was more Constantine’s than Christianity’s. Constantine furthermore showed a triumph did happen when he made major changes to Rome politically after the rise of Christianity. He reimbursed Christians who had their property taken from them during Roman raids and confiscation, he built huge basilicas, and started to destroy pagan temples (Pamphilius). These actions are very similar to Titus’s actions when he conquered Jerusalem. Both emperors brutally made a statement on their policies and made an impact on the societies they triumphed over. After 313 AD, Constantine enforced Christianity as Rome’s religion, snuffing out all pagan worship, and during 70 AD, Titus enforced Paganism as Rome’s empirical religion, snuffing out all Jewish rebellion. However, to make Rome Christian was not Constantine’s main objective when he fought his rivals. Constantine implemented Christianity because he had a vision that if he put the cross on his shields, he would conquer, and he did, therefore, Christianity was a by-product of his conquest (Gerberding). He saw Christianity as something that helped him gain favor with divine authority, but his main intentions were to triumph himself.
	</p>
	There is more evidence why Constantine’s triumph was a triumph for himself rather than a triumph for Christianity. For one, Christianity is not by nature a dominating or a warlike philosophy like Roman philosophy was. One god in Roman culture the people worshipped under Paganism was Mars, who was entirely dedicated to war and fighting and honor. Christianity has no such god like that, but rather had a god that told others to “Love one another” and to “Turn the other cheek” (New Testament). Therefore, Christian triumph would not be celebrated with arches or big parades or parties, but with a more peaceful, sober manner, contrary to the Roman view of triumph, suggesting that Christianity was not the main thing celebrated at the time.
	In conclusion, Christianity did not triumph, but rather Constantine was the one who triumphed, and Christianity followed. The Romans would not see it as a normal triumph and would not-and did not- build an arch to celebrate Christianity’s coming to power. Christianity coming to power was a by-product of the experiences an emperor had, whose primary desires were to defeat his rivals and to rule the world, not primarily to establish a new religion.
