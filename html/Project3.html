		<h1>A series of limericks about CS</h1>
		<h4>By Nathan Driggs</h4>
		<p>The first class is 142.</p>
		<p>Where most learn the rumors are true</p>
		<p>To do well in CS,</p>
		<p>You must be fearless</p>
		<p>And work 'til your fingers turn blue.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Number two is 235.</p>
		<p>The ones whose dreams have survived.</p>
		<p>One thing can be said:</p>
		<p>Screw Iterat'r lab</p>
		<p>But other than that, you'll be just fine.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>For me, next was 224</p>
		<p>Now, my sanity is no more.</p>
		<p>It actually wasn't that bad...</p>
		<p>Well, actually... yeah...</p>
		<p>But still, 236 was worse.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>236 was next in the mix,</p>
		<p>It hit me like tons of bricks</p>
		<p>Working hard is a must,</p>
		<p>Barely got a C+</p>
		<p>I almost failed 236.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>240 is the next class,</p>
		<p>But I was stronger after the last,</p>
		<p>Made all the projects</p>
		<p>But lest we forget,</p>
		<p>I did well, and I did outlast.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Now, I am in 260</p>
		<p>Before this, front end was a mystery.</p>
		<p>I'm ready to work lots,</p>
		<p>Make a few websites,</p>
		<p>It doesn't seem too tricky.</p>
