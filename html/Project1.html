	<h1 class = "HomeTitle">THE 90'S FESTIVAL</h1>
	<p>As a hobby, I sometimes work on a game I make in RPG maker called <strong>"VS THE WORLD"</strong>. In the game, two of the main characters go to a town having a 90's festival, so I designed an entire world based on the decade of <i>Hey Arnold</i> and <i>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</i>. One of the enemies I designed was the Perm Whale, as shown below-

	<p>Don't be disappointed if this pun is too perfect... It's already been done and it can't be taken back now.</p>
	<p>There have been many other enemies, items, and references to the 90's that I've made in addition to the Perm Whale, including-</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The Fresh Mints of Smell Fair</li>
		<li>A Modern Pirate, a guy who illegally downloads DVD's and dresses up like a pirate</li>
		<li>3D Glasses</li>
		<li>Roller Blades</li>
		<li>Slow Internet, an enemy that attacks you by making you really frustrated</li>
		<li>The 90's Jerks, which attack you by calling you names such as "Buttsnerd" and "Turddingus"</li>
		<li>...And many more!</li>
	</ul>
