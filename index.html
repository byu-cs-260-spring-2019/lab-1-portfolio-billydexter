		<h2>Work Experience:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Software Engineering Intern at MasterControl</strong>- I worked as an intern for MasterControl, a company which keeps track of audits and quality assurance of products. I mostly worked on Quality Assurance, writing and debugging tests in the Ruby language, but I also worked on defects and features on both the front end and back end.</li>
			<li><strong>Missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</strong>- For two years, I volunteered as a missionary for my faith. I lived two years in British Colombia, Canada, teaching people about the Gospel of Jesus Christ and helping them to live it. I taught people about my faith, I got experience in talking to people, and did many methods to find people who were interested in listening to us.</li>
			<li><strong>Student at Brigham Young University</strong>- I am currently working to get a computer science degree and I have taken many classes on computer programming, including classes about different data structures, databases, android programming, low-level programming in binary and machine code, and in web design. I am proficient in Java, C++, and Ruby, and I also have dabbled in HTML, Machine Code, CSS, and C.</li>
